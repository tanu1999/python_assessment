    "Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation coefficient of 0.7 between SAT scores and college GPA indicates a strong positive relationship between these two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. In this case, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests a strong positive relationship, meaning that as SAT scores increase, college GPA tends to increase as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of 0.7 indicates a relatively strong correlation, implying that there is a consistent pattern of higher SAT scores being associated with higher college GPAs among the 500 students in the sample. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While there is a strong relationship between SAT scores and college GPA, other factors may also influence college performance, and the correlation coefficient alone does not determine causality.\n",

    "Q-2. Consider a dataset containing the heights (in centimeters) of 1000 individuals. The mean height is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. The dataset is approximately normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Based on this information, answer the following questions: a. What percentage of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm? b. If we randomly select 100 individuals from the dataset, what is the probability that their average height is greater than 175 cm? c. Assuming the dataset follows a normal distribution, what is the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm? d. We know that 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value. What is the approximate height corresponding to this threshold? e. Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for the dataset. f. Calculate the skewness of the dataset and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score formula is: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the height, μ is the mean height, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 160 cm: z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm: z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the percentage of individuals between -1 and 1 standard deviations from the mean. This corresponds to approximately 68% of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. To calculate the probability that the average height of 100 randomly selected individuals is greater than 175 cm, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the population mean is 170 cm and the standard deviation is 10 cm, the mean of the sample means will also be 170 cm, but the standard deviation of the sample means (also known as the standard error) will be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, which is 10 / √100 = 1 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then calculate the z-score for the average height of 175 cm using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and σ is the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the probability that the z-score is greater than 5. This is an extremely small probability, close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. To calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we use the same formula: z = (x - μ) / σ. In this case, x is 185 cm, μ is 170 cm, and σ is 10 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "So the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. To find the approximate height corresponding to the threshold below which 5% of the dataset falls, we can use the z-score. We need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 5%, which is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can use the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ to solve for x, where z is -1.645, μ is 170 cm, and σ is 10 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "-1.645 = (x - 170) / 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for x, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = -1.645 * 10 + 170 = 153.55 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "So the approximate height corresponding to the threshold below which 5% of the dataset falls is 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative variability and is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (σ / μ) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, σ is 10 cm and μ is 170 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (10 / 170) * 100 ≈ 5.88\n",
    "\n",
    "f. skewness = (3 * (mean - median)) / standard deviation\n",

    "Q-12. A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug and wants to compare its effectiveness against a standard drug for treating a particular condition. They conduct a study with two groups: Group A receives the new drug, and Group B receives the standard drug. The company measures the improvement in a specific symptom for both groups after a 4-week treatment period. a. The company collects data from 30 patients in each group and calculates the mean improvement score and the standard deviation of improvement for each group. The mean improvement score for Group A is 2.5 with a standard deviation of 0.8, while the mean improvement score for Group B is 2.2 with a standard deviation of 0.6. Conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. Use a significance level of 0.05. b. Based on the t-test results, state whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not. Provide a conclusion in the context of the study.\n",
